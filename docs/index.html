        <h1>Crypto-Tutor</h1>
        <p>
            Hello, and welcome to the main page for crypto-tutor! Crypto-tutor is a tool that was designed for helping computer science students get
            help with implementing java cryptographic libraries. The tool in this form has two parts: a page that uses the NiCad clone detector to
            find similar code fragments in a repository of known good code, and a page that allows users to go through previously submitted queries
            to the first page. This version of the system is a tool aimed at being a proof of concept for functionality that will allow other students
            in the University of Nebraska system to get help while going through any courses that help students learn cryptographic libraries. It is 
            currently held under the free MIT license, so please feel free to copy and modify the code as you please! The documentation for the two
            applications in this repository are present in the links below. Thanks for checking out our project!
