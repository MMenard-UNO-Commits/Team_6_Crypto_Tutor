# Team_6_Crypto_Tutor
Summary of the system: Our team is seeking to design a system that will become the foundation for a question and answer service for students learning about java cryptographic libraries. Using our system students will be able to make searches based on code snippets that are being flagged as unsecure by a complementary eclipse plugin and find questions that have been asked that use similar code snippets. Using this principle our hope is that students will be able to find answers to their questions more reliably and quickly. If they cannot find an answer to the question that they have they can also submit a new question with their code snippet and a description of a problem. From there both students in the same class and the instructors of the course will be able to provide guidance to students who have questions, with the most successful answers being able to be upvoted to highlight them.

Update 0.1: During this update we created a basic starting UI for our system that includes fields for a student name and ID, as well as a question field where the code snippet goes and a description fields where a description of the problem can be specified.
